Inspired by Latin American critical scholarship on the  &#8220;coloniality of power,&#8221; Amaya demonstrates that nativists use the  privileges associated with citizenship to accumulate power.  That power  is deployed to aggressively shape politics, culture, and the law,  effectively undermining Latino/as who are marked by the ethno-racial and  linguistic difference that nativists love to hate. Yet these social  characteristics present crucial challenges to the political, legal, and  cultural practices that define citizenship. Amaya  examines the role of ethnicity and language in shaping the mediated  public sphere through cases ranging from the participation of Latino/as  in the Iraqi war and pro-immigration reform marches to labor laws  restricting Latino/a participation in English-language media and news  coverage of undocumented immigrant detention centers. Citizenship Excess  demonstrates that the evolution of the idea of citizenship in the  United States and the political and cultural practices that define it  are intricately intertwined with nativism.",
