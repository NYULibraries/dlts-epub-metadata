   "description" : "Can individuals believe that they are acting with integrity, yet in\ndisobedience to the dictates of their conscience? Can they retain\nfidelity to their conscience while ignoring a sense of what integrity\nrequires? Integrity and conscience are often thought to be closely\nrelated, perhaps even different aspects of a single impulse. This timely\nbook supports a different and more complicated view. Acting with\nintegrity and obeying one's conscience might be mutually reinforcing in\nsome settings, but in others they can live in varying degrees of mutual\ntension. Bringing together prominent scholars of legal theory and\npolitical philosophy, the volume addresses both classic ruminations on\nintegrity and conscience by Plato, Hume, and Kant as well as more\ncontemporary examinations of professional ethics and the complex\nrelations among politics, law and personal morality.\n",
