Best known as an important Jewish\nscholar, he also held important rabbinic, teaching, and public positions.\nAlthough born and raised within an orthodox setting, Agus was strongly\ninfluenced by American liberalism and his work displayed modernizing\nsympathies, reservations about nationalism--including some forms of\nZionism--and often severe criticisms of kabbalah. Agus crafted a unique,\nquite American, modernizing vision that ardently sought to remain in\ntouch with the wellsprings of the rabbinic tradition while remaining open\nto the intellectual and moral currents of his own time.\n\nThe Essential Agus brings together a sampling of Agus' most important\npublished and unpublished material in one easily accessible volume.
