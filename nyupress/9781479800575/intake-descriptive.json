    "description": "The cartmen—unskilled workers who hauled goods on one horsecarts—were perhaps the most important labor group in early American  cities. The forerunners of the Teamsters Union, these white-frocked  laborers moved almost all of the nation’s possessions, touching the  lives of virtually every American. New York City Cartmen, 1667–1850  tells the story of this vital group of laborers. Besides documenting  the cartmen’s history, the book also demonstrates the tremendous impact  of government intervention into the American economy via the creation of  labor laws.The cartmen possessed a hard-nosed political awareness,  and because they transported essential goods, they achieved a status in  New York City far above their skills or financial worth. Civic support  and discrimination helped the cartmen create a community all their own.  The cartmen's culture and their relationship with New York's municipal  government are the direct ancestors of the city's fabled taxicab  drivers.But this book is about the city itself.  It is a stirring street-level account of the growth of New York, growth  made possible by the efforts of the cartmen and other unskilled  laborers. Containing 23 black-and-white illustrations, New York City Cartmen is informative reading for social, urban, and labor historians.",
