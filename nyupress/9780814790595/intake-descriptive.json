    "description": "Love and Money argues that we can’t understand contemporary  queer cultures without looking through the lens of social class.  Resisting old divisions between culture and economy, identity and  privilege, left and queer, recognition and redistribution, Love and Money offers supple approaches to capturing class experience and class form in and around queerness.Contrary to familiar dismissals, not every queer television or movie character is like Will Truman on Will and Grace—rich,  white, healthy, professional, detached from politics, community, and  sex. Through ethnographic encounters with readers and cultural producers  and such texts as Boys Don’t Cry, Brokeback Mountain, By Hook or By Crook, and wedding announcements in the New York Times, Love and Money sees  both queerness and class across a range of idioms and practices in  everyday life. How, it asks, do readers of Dorothy Allison’s novels use  her work to find a queer class voice? How do gender and race broker  queer class fantasy? How do independent filmmakers cross back and forth  between industry and queer sectors, changing both places as they go and  challenging queer ideas about bad commerce and bad taste?With  an eye to the nuances and harms of class difference in queerness and a  wish to use culture to forge queer and class affinities, Love and Money  returns class and its politics to the study of queer life.",
