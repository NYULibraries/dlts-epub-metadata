Television executives have been notoriously slow to recognize the  potential popularity of black characters and themes, both at home and  abroad.  As American television brokers increasingly seek revenues  abroad, their assumptions about saleability and audience perceptions  directly influence the global circulation of these programs, as well as  their content. Black Television Travels aims to reclaim the  history of African American television circulation in an effort to  correct and counteract this predominant industry lore.Based  on interviews with television executives and programmers from around  the world, as well as producers in the United States, Havens traces the  shift from an era when national television networks often blocked  African American television from traveling abroad to the transnational,  post-network era of today. While globalization has helped to expand  diversity in African American television, particularly in regard to  genre, it has also resulted in restrictions, such as in the limited  portrayal of African American women in favor of attracting young male  demographics across racial and national boundaries. Havens underscores  the importance of examining boardroom politics as part of racial  discourse in the late modern era, when transnational cultural industries  like television are the primary sources for dominant representations of  blackness.",
