   "description" : "What impact has deconstruction had on the way we read American culture?\nAnd how is American culture itself peculiarly deconstructive?\n\nTo address these questions, this volume brings together some of the most\nprovocative thinkers associated with deconstruction, among them Jacques\nDerrida, Judith Butler, and Avital Ronnel. Ranging across a wide field,\nfrom the ethics of reading to the rhetoric of performance, the\ncontributors offer provocative insights into a new sense of the\npolitical. The America of the volume's title turns out to be the place\nwhere the politics and poetics of responsibility meet. It is also the\nplace where we confront the tension between difference and profound\notherness.\n",
