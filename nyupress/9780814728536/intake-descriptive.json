    "description": "On Friday nights many parents want to have a little fun together&#8212;without the kids. But &#8220;getting a sitter&#8221;&#8212;especially a dependable one&#8212;rarely seems trouble-free. Will the kids be safe with &#8220;that girl&#8221;? It&#8217;s a question that discomfited parents have been asking ever since the emergence of the modern American teenage girl nearly a century ago. In Babysitter, Miriam Forman-Brunell brings critical attention to the ubiquitous, yet long-overlooked babysitter in the popular imagination and American history.Informed by her research on the history of teenage girls&#8217; culture, Forman-Brunell analyzes the babysitter, who has embodied adults&#8217; fundamental apprehensions about girls&#8217; pursuit of autonomy and empowerment. In fact, the grievances go both ways, as girls have been distressed by unsatisfactory working conditions. In her quest to gain a fuller picture of this largely unexamined cultural phenomenon, Forman-Brunell analyzes a wealth of diverse sources, such as The Baby-sitter&#8217;s Club book series, horror movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, urban legends, magazines, newspapers, television shows, pornography, and more.Forman-Brunell shows that beyond the mundane, understandable apprehensions stirred by hiring a caretaker to &#8220;mind the children&#8221; in one&#8217;s own home, babysitters became lightning rods for society&#8217;s larger fears about gender and generational change. In the end, experts&#8217; efforts to tame teenage girls with training courses, handbooks, and other texts failed to prevent generations from turning their backs on babysitting.",
